## 🎯 Project Topic: Stock & Movement
Warehouse and stock movement management are the backbone of WWI’s supply chain.  
The management team requires a **Power BI report** to:
- Monitor inbound, outbound, and on-hand stock levels.  
- Evaluate inventory management effectiveness.  
- Identify risks such as **stock-outs** or **overstocking**.  
- Compare warehouse utilization across different products.  

👉 **Your mission:**  
Build an interactive **dashboard**, derive **insights** from the data, and propose **recommendations** to improve warehouse efficiency.

## 🔄 Workflow
- **Round 1:** Create the prototype.  
- **Round 2:** Iterate continuously from the prototype (at least 3 versions uploaded in the same folder).  
- **Final Round:** Refine the dashboard and record a video presentation analyzing insights and recommendations.  

---

## ✅ Expected Deliverables
- **01 Design Thinking file** (Google Sheet or Excel).  
- **01 Power BI `.pbix` file** containing:  
  - At least **3 dashboard pages** with analysis.  
  - **1 additional page** for recommendations and insights.

## 🚀 Outcome
This project demonstrates not only technical skills in Power BI but also the ability to **think critically, analyze data, and communicate insights effectively** for decision-making.
